## Project Objective: Prediction of house price using various features

Linear regression model to predict house price

Used house price dataset, preprocess the data by checking for null values

Exploring the data, checking for features correlation

Normalizing the data using MinMaxScaler

Spliting the data into train and test using ratio 70:30, defining the model and fiting the train data

Evaluating the model using RMSE(Root mean square error) and r2_score
